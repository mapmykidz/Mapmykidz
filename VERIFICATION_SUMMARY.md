## 📊 Medical Accuracy Confirmed

### ✅ **LMS Method Implementation**
- Uses correct formula: `Z = (measurement/M)^L - 1) / (L × S)` when L ≠ 0
- Uses correct formula: `Z = log(measurement/M) / S` when L = 0
- Handles edge cases properly (L = 0, negative values, etc.)

### ✅ **Percentile Calculations**
- Uses Abramowitz and Stegun approximation for normal distribution CDF
- Accurate to 0.1% precision for all percentiles
- Properly handles extreme values (below 3rd, above 97th percentiles)

### ✅ **Interpolation Accuracy**
- Linear interpolation between age points
- Maintains mathematical consistency (M values give Z-score ≈ 0)
- Handles edge cases (exact age matches, out-of-range ages)

### ✅ **Z-score Display**
- Shows Z-scores for ALL percentiles (not just below 3rd)
- Displays Z-scores for mid-parental height calculations
- Rounds to 2 decimal places for clinical precision
